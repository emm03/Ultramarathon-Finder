        <p>As spring surged into full swing, ultrarunners hit diverse courses from steep alpine ascents to sunny
            lakeside trails. This past weekend was packed with personal bests, scenic routes, and even a 100-mile
            barnburner. Here’s what went down across the globe:</p>

        <h2>Whiskey Basin Trail Runs – Prescott, Arizona</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 20, 2025<br>
            <strong>Distances:</strong> 10k, Half Marathon, 20M, 36k, 88k, and 91k<br>
            <strong>Course:</strong> Groom Creek loop through the Prescott National Forest<br>
            <strong>Weather:</strong> Warm and dry, high of 76°F<br>
            <a href="https://aravaiparunning.com/races/whiskey-basin/" target="_blank">Official Website</a>
        </p>
        <p>Prescott's Whiskey Basin Trail Runs drew hundreds of runners to its rugged and rocky terrain, with the 88k
            and 91k being fan favorites for ultra athletes. Runners described the route as both “peacefully remote” and
            “relentlessly uphill.” The 91k event alone saw over 6,000 feet of vertical gain.</p>

        <h2>Fragrance Lake 50k – Bellingham, Washington</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 20, 2025<br>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 50k<br>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Chuckanut Mountains<br>
            <strong>Weather:</strong> Overcast, 61°F<br>
            <a href="https://www.pacificmultisports.com/fragrance-lake-trail-run" target="_blank">Official Website</a>
        </p>
        <p>One of Washington’s hidden gems, this race offers moss-lined trails, steep switchbacks, and jaw-dropping
            views of Bellingham Bay. With over 7,000 feet of climbing, the Fragrance Lake 50k is no joke. Despite
            challenging conditions, finishers praised the volunteers and scenery as top-tier.</p>

        <h2>The Strolling Jim 40 Miler – Wartrace, Tennessee</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 20, 2025<br>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 41.2 miles<br>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Historic loop course through Bedford County<br>
            <strong>Weather:</strong> Sunny with light winds, 68°F<br>
            <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=110195" target="_blank">Official Website</a>
        </p>
        <p>One of the most unique races in the southeast, the Strolling Jim 40 Miler offers a mix of pavement, hills,
            and hospitality. Runners receive hand-painted awards, and first-timers are always treated to a standing
            ovation at the finish. This year’s winner finished in 4:32:17, the fastest time since 2019.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Whether it was heat, hills, or historic footraces, ultrarunners continued to push their limits across the
            globe this weekend. We salute all participants and volunteers who made it happen. Stay tuned for next week’s
            recap covering April 26–27!</p>
