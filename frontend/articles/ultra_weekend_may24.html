        <p>Over Memorial Day weekend, ultrarunners around North America took to the trails for a packed slate of epic
            races. From the redwood-lined trails of California to the scenic parks of Ontario, we recap four standout
            events that delivered grit, records, and unforgettable finishes.</p>

        <h2>Sugar Badger 50/50 – Belleville, Wisconsin</h2>
        <p>The Sugar Badger delivered fast times and personal bests at both 50k and 50-mile distances. Brian Hall led
            the men’s 50-miler in 7:09:42, while Diane Rathje ran the second-fastest women’s time ever, clocking 7:23:40
            and earning second overall. In the 50k, Martin Earl crushed the field with a new course record of 3:12:38.

        <h2>Sulphur Springs Trail Race – Hamilton, Ontario</h2>
        <p>Canada’s oldest ultramarathon did not disappoint. Paul Vanoostveen destroyed the 100-mile course record in
            14:38:21. Molly Hurford finished third overall in the same race, with a time of 17:22:46 — the
            second-fastest women's time in race history. Karen Holland and Robert Brouillette both set course records in
            the 100k. In the 50k, Tanis Bolton topped the women’s field in 4:14:06, while Alex Forte clocked a blazing
            3:22:02 for the men’s win.</p>

        <h2>What The Duck 12-Hour – Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania</h2>
        <p>A fixed-time format brought strategy into play as runners aimed to complete as many loops as possible.
            Anthony Reynolds topped the field with 49 loops (69.5 miles). Katie Hooper led the women with 39 laps,
            placing 10th overall. Over 190 runners completed at least one lap, many donning duck-themed costumes along
            the way.</p>

        <h2>May Madness 50k – Hoffman, North Carolina</h2>
        <p>On the rugged North Carolina trails, Anthony Kamps delivered a commanding 3:41:32 win in the men’s race,
            while Tiff Joh paced the women with a 4:58:51 finish. This small but spirited race continues to grow each
            year, drawing local legends and first-timers alike.</p>
