        <p>The final weekend of April brought crisp air, dramatic terrain, and spring trail conditions that challenged
            runners across several states. Here’s what went down in the ultrarunning scene this weekend:</p>

        <h2>Wild Canyon Ultra – Fruita, Colorado</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 27, 2025<br>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 50k, 50-mile<br>
            <strong>Weather:</strong> Sunny and dry, 65°F<br>
            <strong>Terrain:</strong> Slickrock, ridgelines, and technical desert trail
        </p>
        <p>This scenic Colorado race featured stunning views of the Colorado River. Known for its rugged elevation gain,
            the 50-mile event saw several sub-9-hour finishes despite wind exposure along exposed ridges. Local favorite
            Sarah Jensen clinched the women's win in the 50k with a time of 4:37:12.</p>

        <h2>Broken Arrow Winter Ultra – Mount Shasta, California</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 26, 2025<br>
            <strong>Distance:</strong> 12-hour timed<br>
            <strong>Course:</strong> 2.5-mile snow-covered alpine loop<br>
            <strong>Weather:</strong> Breezy and icy, 38°F
        </p>
        <p>Snow and slush returned for this high-elevation timed race. Runners pushed through intermittent flurries,
            battling frostbite temps at night. The winner of the solo 12-hour race completed 48 miles (19 loops),
            navigating icy corners by headlamp.</p>

        <h2>Big South 100k – Pisgah National Forest, North Carolina</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 27, 2025<br>
            <strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 9,200 ft<br>
            <strong>Notable Feature:</strong> River crossing at mile 47
        </p>
        <p>This Southeastern beast delivered on its reputation. Dense forest, rolling thunder, and a slick riverbed
            crossing at dusk made for a wild finish. GPS signals dropped mid-race, adding to the challenge. Over 60% of
            runners completed the full 100k distance.</p>

        <hr />
        <p>As spring transitions into early summer, the ultrarunning calendar only ramps up. Hats off to all those who
            braved heat, snow, and unpredictable terrain this weekend. Stay tuned as we move into May — peak race season
            awaits!</p>
