        <h1>Ultra Weekend Highlights — May 31–June 1</h1>

        <p>June kicked off with a bang across the ultra world. From flat and fast loops in Texas to technical climbs in
            West Virginia, ultrarunners showed grit in every environment. This weekend was packed with personal records,
            muddy trails, and even a few flamingo-themed aid stations. Here's what went down:</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.trailracingovertexas.com/brazos-bend" target="_blank">Brazos Bend 100</a> – Needville,
            Texas</h2>
        <p>Brazos Bend is known for being one of the fastest 100-mile races in the country — and once again, the gators
            spectated while the runners crushed PRs. <strong>David Swidas</strong> ran a blazing
            <strong>13:28:10</strong> to take the men’s 100-mile win, and <strong>Laura Watkins</strong> led the women
            in <strong>17:05:43</strong>. Flat terrain and high humidity made this a sufferfest for some, but over 230
            finished the 100-mile event. Runners praised the course support, wildlife sightings, and endless cheering.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.highlandskytrailrun.com" target="_blank">Highlands Sky 40</a> – Davis, West Virginia
        </h2>
        <p>Set in the Monongahela National Forest, this 40-mile point-to-point trail race delivers serious elevation
            gain (~5,400 ft), rocky ridgelines, and lush Appalachian singletrack. The course was slick from recent
            storms, but that didn’t stop <strong>Luke Scherer</strong> from clocking a <strong>6:14:01</strong> finish,
            or <strong>Stacey Gross</strong> from claiming the women's win in <strong>7:05:22</strong>. Runners crossed
            creeks, summited Spruce Knob, and endured fog-drenched climbs.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://yetitrailrunners.com/yeti-100k/" target="_blank">Yeti 100k</a> – Abingdon, Virginia</h2>
        <p>Runners love the Yeti vibe — good music, rails-to-trails, and unicorn costumes. The point-to-point 100k
            featured cool temps at the start but climbed into the 80s by mid-race. <strong>Matt Wells</strong> ran a
            solo effort in <strong>7:56:44</strong>, while <strong>Erin Barnes</strong> captured the women’s win in
            <strong>9:32:10</strong>. A traveling aid station with disco lights was a crowd favorite.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.riverlands100.com" target="_blank">Riverlands 100</a> – Turner, Maine</h2>
        <p>A technical 20-mile loop in Androscoggin Riverlands State Park set the stage for brutal, muddy miles. This
            year’s conditions were unusually wet, and over 40% of runners dropped. Still, <strong>Jake Costa</strong>
            ground out the 100-mile win in <strong>21:47:08</strong>. Finisher buckles were hand-forged by a local
            blacksmith — a detail runners loved.</p>

        <hr />
        <p>Besides racing, June 1st also marked <strong>Global Running Day countdown week</strong>, with many runners
            logging “shakeout” miles and participating in local community fun runs. Strava challenges launched Saturday,
            offering badges for back-to-back long runs — did you get yours?</p>

        <p>To every runner who raced, crewed, or simply laced up this weekend — we see you. Onward through June!</p>
